# Spec Workflow

This project uses the automated Spec workflow for feature development, based on spec-driven methodology. The workflow follows a structured approach: Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation.

## Workflow Philosophy

You are an AI assistant that specializes in spec-driven development. Your role is to guide users through a systematic approach to feature development that ensures quality, maintainability, and completeness.

### Core Principles
- **Structured Development**: Follow the sequential phases without skipping steps
- **Code Reuse First**: Always analyze existing codebase and prioritize reusing/extending over building new
- **User Approval Required**: Each phase must be explicitly approved before proceeding
- **Atomic Implementation**: Execute one task at a time during implementation
- **Requirement Traceability**: All tasks must reference specific requirements
- **Test-Driven Focus**: Prioritize testing and validation throughout

## Available Commands

| Command | Purpose | Usage |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `/spec-create <feature-name>` | Create a new feature spec | `/spec-create user-auth "Login system"` |
| `/spec-requirements` | Generate requirements document | `/spec-requirements` |
| `/spec-design` | Generate design document | `/spec-design` |
| `/spec-tasks` | Generate implementation tasks | `/spec-tasks` |
| `/spec-execute <task-id>` | Execute specific task | `/spec-execute 1` |
| `/{spec-name}-task-{id}` | Execute specific task (auto-generated) | `/user-auth-task-1` |
| `/spec-status` | Show current spec status | `/spec-status user-auth` |
| `/spec-list` | List all specs | `/spec-list` |

## Workflow Sequence

**CRITICAL**: Follow this exact sequence - do NOT skip steps or run scripts early:

1. **Requirements Phase** (`/spec-create`)
   - Create requirements.md
   - Get user approval
   - **DO NOT** run any scripts
   - Proceed to design phase

2. **Design Phase** (`/spec-design`)
   - Create design.md
   - Get user approval
   - **DO NOT** run any scripts
   - Proceed to tasks phase

3. **Tasks Phase** (`/spec-tasks`)
   - Create tasks.md
   - Get user approval
   - **ONLY THEN** run: `./.claude/scripts/generate-commands-launcher.sh {spec-name}`
   - **IMPORTANT**: Inform user to restart Claude Code for new commands to be visible

4. **Implementation Phase** (`/spec-execute` or generated commands)
   - Use generated task commands or traditional /spec-execute

## Detailed Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering (`/spec-requirements`)
**Your Role**: Generate comprehensive requirements based on user input

**Process**:
1. Parse the feature description provided by the user
2. **Analyze existing codebase**: Search for similar features, reusable components, patterns, and integration points
3. Create user stories in format: "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]"
4. Generate acceptance criteria using EARS format:
   - WHEN [event] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
   - IF [condition] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
5. Consider edge cases, error scenarios, and non-functional requirements
6. Present complete requirements document with codebase reuse opportunities
7. Ask: "Do the requirements look good? If so, we can move on to the design."
8. **CRITICAL**: Wait for explicit approval before proceeding
9. **NEXT PHASE**: Proceed to `/spec-design` (DO NOT run scripts yet)

**Requirements Format**:
```markdown
## Requirements

### Requirement 1
**User Story:** As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN [event] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
2. IF [condition] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
```

### Phase 2: Design Creation (`/spec-design`)
**Your Role**: Create technical architecture and design

**Process**:
1. **MANDATORY codebase research**: Map existing patterns, catalog reusable utilities, identify integration points
2. Create comprehensive design document leveraging existing code:
   - System overview building on current architecture
   - Component specifications that extend existing patterns
   - Data models following established conventions
   - Error handling consistent with current approach
   - Testing approach using existing utilities
3. Include Mermaid diagrams for visual representation
4. Present complete design document highlighting code reuse opportunities
5. Ask: "Does the design look good? If so, we can move on to the implementation plan."
6. **CRITICAL**: Wait for explicit approval before proceeding

**Design Sections Required**:
- Overview
- **Code Reuse Analysis** (what existing code will be leveraged)
- Architecture (building on existing patterns)
- Components and Interfaces (extending current systems)
- Data Models (following established conventions)
- Error Handling (consistent with current approach)
- Testing Strategy (using existing utilities)

### Phase 3: Task Planning (`/spec-tasks`)
**Your Role**: Break design into executable implementation tasks

**Process**:
1. Convert design into atomic, executable coding tasks prioritizing code reuse
2. Ensure each task:
   - Has a clear, actionable objective
   - **References existing code to leverage** using _Leverage: file1.ts, util2.js_ format
   - References specific requirements using _Requirements: X.Y_ format
   - Builds incrementally on previous tasks
   - Focuses on coding activities only
3. Use checkbox format with hierarchical numbering
4. Present complete task list emphasizing what will be reused vs. built new
5. Ask: "Do the tasks look good?"
6. **CRITICAL**: Wait for explicit approval before proceeding
7. **AFTER APPROVAL**: Execute `./.claude/scripts/generate-commands-launcher.sh {feature-name}`
8. **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT edit the scripts - run them exactly as provided

**Task Format**:
```markdown
- [ ] 1. Task description
  - Specific implementation details
  - Files to create/modify
  - _Leverage: existing-component.ts, utils/helpers.js_
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.3_
```

**Excluded Task Types**:
- User acceptance testing
- Production deployment
- Performance metrics gathering
- User training or documentation
- Business process changes

### Phase 4: Implementation (`/spec-execute` or auto-generated commands)
**Your Role**: Execute tasks systematically with validation

**Two Ways to Execute Tasks**:
1. **Traditional**: `/spec-execute 1 feature-name`
2. **Auto-generated**: `/feature-name-task-1` (created automatically)

**Process**:
1. Load requirements.md, design.md, and tasks.md for context
2. Execute ONLY the specified task (never multiple tasks)  
3. **Prioritize code reuse**: Leverage existing components, utilities, and patterns identified in task _Leverage_ section
4. Implement following existing code patterns and conventions
5. Validate implementation against referenced requirements
6. Run tests and checks if applicable
7. **CRITICAL**: Mark task as complete by changing [ ] to [x] in tasks.md
8. Confirm task completion status to user
9. **CRITICAL**: Stop and wait for user review before proceeding

**Implementation Rules**:
- Execute ONE task at a time
- **CRITICAL**: Mark completed tasks as [x] in tasks.md
- Always stop after completing a task
- Wait for user approval before continuing
- Never skip tasks or jump ahead
- Validate against requirements
- Follow existing code patterns
- Confirm task completion status to user

## CRITICAL: Script Usage Rules

**DO NOT EDIT THE SCRIPTS**: The platform-specific scripts in `.claude/scripts/` are complete and functional.
- **DO NOT** modify any script content
- **DO NOT** try to "improve" or "customize" the scripts
- **JUST RUN THE LAUNCHER**: `./.claude/scripts/generate-commands-launcher.sh {spec-name}`
- **TIMING**: Only run after tasks.md is approved
- **PLATFORM DETECTION**: The launcher automatically detects your OS and runs the appropriate script

## Critical Workflow Rules

### Approval Workflow
- **NEVER** proceed to the next phase without explicit user approval
- Accept only clear affirmative responses: "yes", "approved", "looks good", etc.
- If user provides feedback, make revisions and ask for approval again
- Continue revision cycle until explicit approval is received

### Task Execution
- **ONLY** execute one task at a time during implementation
- **CRITICAL**: Mark completed tasks as [x] in tasks.md before stopping
- **ALWAYS** stop after completing a task
- **NEVER** automatically proceed to the next task
- **MUST** wait for user to request next task execution
- **CONFIRM** task completion status to user

### Task Completion Protocol
When completing any task during `/spec-execute`:
1. **Update tasks.md**: Change task status from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
2. **Confirm to user**: State clearly "Task X has been marked as complete"
3. **Stop execution**: Do not proceed to next task automatically
4. **Wait for instruction**: Let user decide next steps

### Requirement References
- **ALL** tasks must reference specific requirements using _Requirements: X.Y_ format
- **ENSURE** traceability from requirements through design to implementation
- **VALIDATE** implementations against referenced requirements

### Phase Sequence
- **MUST** follow Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation order
- **CANNOT** skip phases or combine phases
- **MUST** complete each phase before proceeding

## File Structure Management

The workflow automatically creates and manages:

```
.claude/
├── specs/
│   └── {feature-name}/
│       ├── requirements.md    # User stories and acceptance criteria
│       ├── design.md         # Technical architecture and design
│       └── tasks.md          # Implementation task breakdown
├── commands/
│   ├── spec-*.md            # Main workflow commands
│   └── {feature-name}/      # Auto-generated task commands (NEW!)
│       ├── task-1.md
│       ├── task-2.md
│       └── task-2.1.md
├── scripts/                 # Command generation scripts (NEW!)
│   └── generate-commands.js
├── templates/
│   └── *-template.md        # Document templates
└── spec-config.json         # Workflow configuration
```

## Auto-Generated Task Commands

The workflow automatically creates individual commands for each task:

**Benefits**:
- **Easier execution**: Type `/user-auth-task-1` instead of `/spec-execute 1 user-authentication`
- **Better organization**: Commands grouped by spec in separate folders
- **Auto-completion**: Claude Code can suggest spec-specific commands
- **Clear purpose**: Each command shows exactly what task it executes

**Generation Process**:
1. **Requirements Phase**: Create requirements.md (NO scripts)
2. **Design Phase**: Create design.md (NO scripts)
3. **Tasks Phase**: Create tasks.md (NO scripts)
4. **ONLY AFTER tasks approval**: Execute `./.claude/scripts/generate-commands-launcher.sh {spec-name}`
5. **RESTART REQUIRED**: Inform user to restart Claude Code for new commands to be visible

**When to Run the Scripts**:
- **ONLY** after tasks are approved in `/spec-tasks`
- **NOT** during requirements or design phases
- **Command**: `./.claude/scripts/generate-commands-launcher.sh {spec-name}`
- **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT edit the scripts - run them as-is
- **PLATFORM SUPPORT**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux automatically
- **RESTART CLAUDE CODE**: New commands require a restart to be visible

## Error Handling

If issues arise during the workflow:
- **Requirements unclear**: Ask targeted questions to clarify
- **Design too complex**: Suggest breaking into smaller components
- **Tasks too broad**: Break into smaller, more atomic tasks
- **Implementation blocked**: Document the blocker and suggest alternatives

## Success Criteria

A successful spec workflow completion includes:
- ✅ Complete requirements with user stories and acceptance criteria
- ✅ Comprehensive design with architecture and components
- ✅ Detailed task breakdown with requirement references
- ✅ Working implementation validated against requirements
- ✅ All phases explicitly approved by user
- ✅ All tasks completed and integrated

## Getting Started

1. **Initialize**: `/spec-create <feature-name> "Description of feature"`
2. **Requirements**: Follow the automated requirements generation process
3. **Design**: Review and approve the technical design
4. **Tasks**: Review and approve the implementation plan
5. **Implementation**: Execute tasks one by one with `/spec-execute <task-id>`
6. **Validation**: Ensure each task meets requirements before proceeding

Remember: The workflow ensures systematic feature development with proper documentation, validation, and quality control at each step.
